🚀 **ABC Call Volume Trend Analysis: Optimizing Customer Experience** 📞📊  

In this project, I analyzed **inbound call trends** for the Customer Experience (CX) team to enhance operational efficiency, reduce call abandonment rates, and improve **manpower planning** using **data analytics**.  

---

### **Key Objectives**  
1️⃣ **Understand Call Trends**: Analyze call volumes, durations, and statuses (answered, abandoned, transferred).  
2️⃣ **Manpower Planning**: Propose an optimized staffing strategy to reduce call abandonment rates from **30% to 10%**.  
3️⃣ **Night Shift Optimization**: Develop a staffing plan for night calls to ensure customer satisfaction.  

---

### **Analysis Conducted**  
✅ **Call Volume Analysis**:  
- Identified peak and non-peak hours by analyzing call volumes across **time buckets**.  
- Peak hours: **10 AM to 6 PM**, requiring higher agent allocation.  

✅ **Average Call Duration**:  
- Analyzed call durations per time bucket to determine efficiency.  
- Observed that durations are longer in afternoon slots, peaking at **181 seconds** during 4–5 PM.  

✅ **Manpower Planning**:  
- Calculated **minimum agents required** to reduce the abandonment rate to 10%.  
- Optimized staffing for **peak hours** while maintaining sufficient coverage during non-peak times.  

✅ **Night Shift Strategy**:  
- Proposed a **rotational staffing plan** to manage **30% night call volume** effectively.  
- Ensures customer support from **9 PM to 9 AM** with minimal resources.

### **Key Insights**  
🔹 **Call Abandonment Trends**: High abandonment rates during peak hours indicate a need for better agent allocation.  
🔹 **Peak Hours**: Call volumes are highest between **10 AM and 2 PM**, demanding focused manpower planning.  
🔹 **Efficiency Gaps**: Longer call durations in the afternoon suggest complex customer issues requiring process optimization.  
🔹 **Night Shift Support**: Lack of agents during night hours impacts customer satisfaction; addressing this can improve loyalty.

### **Recommendations**  
1. **Optimize Agent Allocation**: Increase agents during peak hours and ensure consistent coverage during non-peak and night shifts.  
2. **Adopt AI Tools**: Integrate **IVR**, **RPA**, and **Predictive Analytics** to automate routine queries and reduce queue times.  
3. **Monitor Call Durations**: Train agents to resolve calls efficiently, focusing on high-duration slots for process improvement.
